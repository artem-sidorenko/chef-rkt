This cookbook uses
 - [foodcritic](http://www.foodcritic.io/) and [rubocop](http://batsov.com/rubocop/) for linting
 - [chefspec](http://sethvargo.github.io/chefspec/) for unit tests
 - [inspec](https://github.com/chef/inspec) with [test-kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/) for integration tests

Check linting:
```bash
$ make lint
```

Run unit tests:
```bash
$ make spec
```

Run integration tests:
```bash
$ make kitchen
```

Run all tests:
```bash
$ make test
```

Please add/extend according tests together with code changes.

Linting and unit tests can be executed automatically within your fork by GitLab CI runners of gitlab.com.

Integration tests require VMs on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).
If you want to execute integration tests automatically via GitLab CI you should configure [secret variables](http://doc.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/README.html#user-defined-variables-secure-variables) in your fork:
 - `DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Your DigitalOcean [access token](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-api-v2)
 - `DIGITALOCEAN_SSH_KEY_IDS` - DigitalOcean ID of ssh key which is used in order to access the VMs
 - `CI_SSH_KEY_PEM` - Private SSH key which is used in order to access the VMs
